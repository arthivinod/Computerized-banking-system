# Computerized-banking-system
This project is about computerising the work of a banking system. To accomplish this it is essential to know the important procedures taking place in a banking system. The main processes involve depositing and withdrawing money from an account. This requires the user to have an account of his/her own with a specified and unique account number through which they can access their account.
